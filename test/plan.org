* Server
** Basic
- response status is 200

** List directory
Since the style is not important, try not to specify the implementation too
much.

- =document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].textContent= should match some file
  names.

  I think this is good enough.
** Logging
*Not important: let's omit it for now*

* Client-side skewer.js
An area we need to expand greatly by modelling after Emacs [[https://github.com/skeeto/skewer-mode][skeeto/skewer-mode]].

However, we're not aiming at perfect cross-browser compatibility or effect, so
=jsdom= and =zombie= should be good enough for testing.

** One-way command
*** =ping=

*** =log=

*** =reload=

* Bin
Use shell =expect= to test CLI tool =skewer=.

** Start up normally
- expect some log to stdout
- the port environment variable is respected
